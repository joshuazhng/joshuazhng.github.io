                <h3>Economist</h3>
                <p>Ngoc Ngo completed her PhD in Applied Economics with a focus on Industrial Organization at Northeastern University in 2019. Before her doctoral studies, Ngoc attended Bates College, where she graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in Economics.</p>
                <p>Ngoc’s PhD dissertation applied a modified version of the random-coefficient discrete choice model to quantify the impact of United Airlines’ decision to cease its hub operations at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on consumer welfare and the firm’s profits. In general, Ngoc is passionate about working with data to formulate economic models to solve real-world problems.</p>
                <p>Since joining CD, Ngoc has built models and conducted analyses related to damage calculation, valuation of new technologies and determining reasonable royalty terms in telecommunication and pharmaceutical industries. Ngoc is developing improved algorithms to rank patents and evaluate innovators’ patent portfolio; and has worked on various economic research to enhance methodologies used in Intellectual Property related litigation.</p>

                <h2>Ratib Ali</h2>
                <h3>Economist</h3>
                <p>Ratib Ali has a PhD in Economics from Boston College, with a focus in industrial organization and competition policy.</p>
                <p>Ratib’s research revolved around how government regulation informs and impacts firm incentives. Ratib’s PhD thesis modeled demand for and supply of air travel to estimate the marginal cost of an “airport slot” (permit to fly one flight) at Reagan Airport, allowing him to compute the changes in consumer welfare stemming from structural remedies mandated by DOJ following the US Airways-American Airlines merger. By exploiting the exogeneity of Newark Airport’s dissolution of slot controls, Ratib also investigated the foreclosure incentives engendered by the “use-it-or-lose-it” feature of freely provided airport slots.</p>
                <p>Prior to joining CD, Ratib worked at The Brattle Group as an Associate, where he focused in analyzing antitrust claims and estimating economic damages in industries as varied as healthcare, e-commerce, gig economy, and fine arts. Ratib is the former Economic Analyst at the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, Antitrust Division. There, his economic analyses and litigation support aided in enforcing federal and state antitrust laws in investigations spanning pharmaceutical, technology, and aviation industries.</p>
                <p>Ratib also enjoys teaching; he taught Principles and Intermediate Microeconomics at Boston College from 2016 to 2019, Principles and Cultural Economics at Emerson College from 2019 to 2020, and teaches Intermediate Microeconomics at Tufts University since 2023.</p>

                <h2>Chen Wang</h2>
                <h3>Associate</h3>
                <p>Chen Wang received his Ph.D. in Economics from Clemson University in 2019 and Master’s degree in Economics from North Carolina State University in 2013.</p>
                <p>Chen’s fields of interest include industrial organization, applied econometrics, and empirical microeconomics. His job market paper analyzes competition among firms and their choices on product quality and variety in markets with unified final good prices as applied to the U.S. film industry. By constructing a theoretical model and applying multiple econometric methods, this research reveals the previously unknown effect of expected market demand of the release week on the choices of films’ production budgets and genres, which are proxies for quality and variety, respectively.</p>
                <p>In addition to research, Chen has extensive teaching experience as an instructor at Clemson University. He taught Principles of Microeconomics and Principles of Macroeconomics from 2015 to 2019.</p>
                <p>Prior to joining CD, Chen was a transfer pricing Economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC in San Francisco. At PwC, Chen participated in and managed a wide range of transfer pricing projects serving various clients, which are mostly large multinational enterprises around the globe.</p>
